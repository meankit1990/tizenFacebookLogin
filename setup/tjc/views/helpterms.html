				<p>TJC are currently collecting information on all their types of cookies and carrying out a thorough analysis to ensure that all customers are notified and kept up to speed on any information that you may pass onto us.. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>We've implemented the Google Analytics features which are based on Display Advertising.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Timed Auctions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>We start a Timed Auction with a set quantity for sale. The quantity is reduced every time a bid is made. Timed Auctions are recognized on TV by the fact that a clock is displayed throughout the auction. Once the auction has been introduced the clock counts down to zero. </li>
					<li>We keep lowering the price of the jewellery until the quantity reaches zero or the clock reaches zero. The auction ends when the clock reaches zero, or the quantity sells out (whichever is first). When the auction is ended by a clock hitting zero everyone pays the final price displayed on screen at that time.</li>
					<li>The available quantity for sale for each auction is fixed in advance, but is not always displayed on screen. Participants in any of our auctions must be individuals aged 18 or over. The placement of a bid is legally binding and may not be withdrawn by the bidder after it is placed. The one screen start price is not implying a value or worth of the jewellery it is simply a random place chosen to start each auction. </li>
					<li>Everybody pays the final lowest price. </li>
